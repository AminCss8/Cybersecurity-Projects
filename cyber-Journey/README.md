# Cybersecurity Learning Journey  05.08.2025

Hi, I'm Amin, a 17-year-old aspiring security engineer. This repository documents my hands-on approach to learning cybersecurity through practical Python projects.

## Core Projects

 Network Health Checker (`network_health.py`)
A comprehensive network diagnostic tool that:
- Checks host availability via ICMP ping
- Scans for open TCP ports
- Performs DNS and reverse DNS lookups

 Port Scanner (`portScanner.py`)
A custom TCP port scanner featuring:
- Configurable port ranges
- Timeout handling
- Clean terminal output

Router Locator (`router_finder.py`)
Automatically detects the default gateway IP by:
- Parsing network routing tables
- Cross-verifying with ARP cache
- Providing fallback detection methods

#Learning Progress

*Week 1: Foundations**
- Python scripting essentials
- Network protocols (ICMP, TCP, DNS)
- Basic security concepts
- Git and GitHub workflow



#06.08.2025

Today i upgraded my port scanner via threading
this is the new result!(`portScannerNew.py`)

#07.08.2025

Today i didn't have much time and wanted to work on more projects but for today i build an UDP Scanner 
- A UDP scanner checks if a specific UDP port on a device is reachable by sending a message to that port and waiting for a        response.
